CPP File Transfer Application

This folder contains client.cpp, server.cpp, and unit tests for both classes. which sends an auxiliary file and checks the code, and tells if file is being sent successfully or not.

Java File Transfer Application

This folder contains JavaClient.cpp, JavaServer.cpp, and unit tests for both classes. which sends an auxiliary file and checks the code, and tells if file is being sent successfully or not.

Note: More over code works perfectly while inter-platform transfer is possible. you can send file from cpp server to java client or vice-versa.
Donâ€™t forget to change the ports, IP address and file paths before running the code.
